### Project: UniCa$h

UniCa$h is a finance tracking application for university students who want to be more financially conscious.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 19 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: *Edit transaction command* [[PR #64](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/64)]
  * What it does: *Edits an existing transaction in UniCa$h.*
  * Justification: *The `edit` command was refactored from AB3's implementation to make modifications on `Transaction` objects and its fields*
  * Credits: *AddressBook - Level 3, which UniCa$h's edit feature was refactored from*

* **New Feature**: *Expense Summary Plots*
  * What it does: *Generates a pop-up window which contains summary plots (pie chart [[PR #100](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/100)] and line chart [[PR #124](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/124)]) for the user's expenses. The plots provide a high-level overview of the user's expenses broken down per category and per month.*
  * Justification: *It might be difficult for users to understand their spending habits. This feature provides some simple analytics tools to aid in this regard, which can be further improved in future iterations.*
  * Highlights: *Fixing the assigned  colours to each pie of the pie chart as JavaFX repeats the assigned colours after 8 pies are added to the chart.*

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Added and improved tests written for add, find, and delete transaction commands [[PR #88](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/88)]
