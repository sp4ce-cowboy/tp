### Project: UniCa$h 

UniCa$h is a finance tracking application for university students who want to be more financially conscious. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 19 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Get Total Expenditure**: pull requests [\#143](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/143), [\#115](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/115), [\#80](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/80), [\#65](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/65)
  * What it does: retrieves the total expenditure of the user given a mandatory month and optional category and year. Only includes the spending on expense transactions.
  * Justification: our users may want to view an overview of their total expenditure in a month to more accurately set their budget.
  * Highlights: provides users with a refined way to search by month (+ year) (+ category).
* **Budget Management Logic**: pull requests [\#129](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/129), [\#145](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/145)
  * What it does: provides users with a way to create a global daily/weekly/monthly budget to track their overall expenditure with respect to the budget.
  * Justification: after understanding their total expenditure, users may want to then set budgets to better manage and track their spending.
  * Highlights: modified the persistence system to also store the budget information.
* **Setup TestFX for UI testing**: pull requests [\#93](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/93)
  * What it does: provides ways to automatically perform UI testing such as button clicks or keyboard inputs.
  * Justification: ensure that common manual testing cases are checked without human intervention.
  * Highlights: increased unit test coverage from ~80% to > 90%, modified the CI using GitHub Actions and Gradle to ensure that reported coverage on CodeCov includes UI tests.
* **Command Usage Message Builder**: pull requests [\#117](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/117)
  * What it does: generates command usage messages in a standardised format.
  * Justification: generating raw command usage `MESSAGE_USAGE` with String concatenation is prone to human error and may not be uniform across commands.
  * Highlights: using builder pattern to implement usage message builder.

  * Integrate UI testing reporting with CodeCov, increasing visible test coverage from ~80% without UI coverage to > 90% with UI coverage (Pull request [\#93](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/pull/93))
    * Includes changes to Gradle configuration and GitHub actions, more documentation in [developer guide for Continuous Integration](../DeveloperGuide.html#continuous-integration-ci)
